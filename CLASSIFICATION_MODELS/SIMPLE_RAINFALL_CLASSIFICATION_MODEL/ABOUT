Simple Rainfall Classification Project
Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning classifier to predict rainfall based on historical weather data. The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, with the goal of predicting the likelihood of rainfall.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at:
Simple Rainfall Classification Dataset

Objective
The objective is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts whether it will rain or not. This model can be beneficial for various applications, including agriculture and disaster management.

Steps Involved
Data Preparation:

Loaded and explored the dataset.
Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values.
Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
Normalized numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
Model Building:

Built a neural network using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
The model architecture includes an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.
Compiled the model with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
Model Training:

Trained the model on the normalized training data for 200 epochs.
Used a validation split to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model on the test data.
Calculated accuracy, precision, and recall scores to assess model performance.
Results
Validation Accuracy: 1.0000
Test Accuracy: 1.0000
Test Precision: 1.0000
Test Recall: 1.0000
The model achieved perfect scores on the test data, indicating it performed exceptionally well on this dataset. However, it's essential to consider potential overfitting and the need for further validation on different datasets to ensure generalizability.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a simple but effective rainfall prediction model using TensorFlow. The high performance suggests the model can provide valuable insights and aid in decision-making processes related to agriculture and disaster management.
