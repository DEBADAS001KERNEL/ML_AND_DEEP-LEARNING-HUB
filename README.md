Welcome to the ML and DL Hub repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of diverse machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) projects, catering to a variety of applications and techniques. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the basics or an advanced practitioner seeking complex projects, you'll find valuable resources here.

Contents
1. Regression
Projects involving various regression techniques to predict continuous outcomes.
Examples include linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, and more.
2. Classification
Projects focused on classifying data into distinct categories.
Includes logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.
3. Computer Vision
Projects leveraging DL to process and interpret visual data.
Includes image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and generative adversarial networks (GANs).
4. Transfer Learning
Projects demonstrating the use of pre-trained models to solve new tasks with minimal training.
Examples include fine-tuning models like VGG, ResNet, Inception, and BERT.
5. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Projects utilizing RNNs for sequential data analysis.
Includes examples of LSTM, GRU, and applications in natural language processing (NLP) and sequence prediction.
6. Time Series Analysis
Projects focused on analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data.
Techniques include ARIMA models, seasonal decomposition, and LSTM-based approaches.
Getting Started
Each project directory contains:

A README file explaining the project's objective, data used, and the approach taken.
